#To make graphs with ggplot2, the data must be in a data frame, and in “long” (as opposed to wide) format.
#So, if your data is in wide format as below:
                subject sex control cond1 cond2
                     1   M     7.9  12.3  10.7
                     2   F     6.3  10.6  11.1
                     3   F     9.5  13.1  13.8
                     4   M    11.5  13.4  12.9
#you can not plot a figure because R plotting depends on the colume not row. So you need to convert or reshape them in a longer format.
#Tips: Every colume should contain one meaning. The group or class cannot be separated which should be concatenate in one colume.
                gather() and spread() from the tidyr package. This is a newer interface to the reshape2 package.
                melt() and dcast() from the reshape2 package.
